What goes in what?

First of all: what files do you have:

main.cpp:
    Making the audioCallback object.
callback.h:
    Create the _synth objects and run them
callback.cpp:
    Call getSample() and send the value in the audiobuffer.
makefile:
    Tell what the compiler needs to include.
jack_module:
    Some wizardery to make the audio work.




synth.h:
    Make the synth class. Constructor / Destructor.
    Declare the functions for the synth .cpp file.
        Variables:
            samplerate
            midinote




additive.h:
    Make x amount of sine oscillators.
    getSample();


oscillator.h:
    Class


    float samplerate = 44100;

    tick()

    getSample(); (summing all the oscillator)

    setFrequency()
    getFrequency()

sine.h:
    Make the sine class + const / destruct.
